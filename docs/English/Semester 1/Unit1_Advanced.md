## Shakespeare's words and inventions:

Depending on who you believe, the English language owes a debt of gratitude to Shakespeare for the invention, over four centuries ago, of anywhere between 400 and 2,500 words and phrases that we still use today. These include everyday words like 'excitement', 'gossip' and 'priceless'.

### 1. -> B

On closer inspection, however, it can be argued that Shakespeare's greatest skill wasn't in coining new expressions. It may well be that it was his ability to hear how language was evolving around him, in addition to his ability to manipulate language - something that humans continue to do to this day.

### 2. -> G

That remains unanswered. It's hard to say for certain, but it seems more likely that Shakespeare's real talent was as a student of words and their changing usage; that, rather than being the source of so many original lexical items, Shakespeare's plays were simply the first time they were immortalised in print.

### 3. -> D

Its conclusions are something parents in many parts of the world can relate to even today, when they are puzzled, to say the least, by how their children are communicating with each other. Now, it's text messaging and social media that young people use to keep in touch, but they remain the driving force behind language change. Needless to say, future generations will use language differently, too.

### 4. -> F

'Blood-stained' is a great example of this. The words 'blood' and 'stained' were certainly not inventions of Shakespeare's, but the first time they appeared as a compound adjective was in Titus Andronicus. Of course, compounding words is something we continue to do today - think 'podcast' or 'frenemy'.

### 5. -> C

They simply refuse to accept that 'message' is no longer just something you can send or receive, but also something you do. But, if you object to the use of such a word as a different part of speech, then you are, it's safe to say, against one of Shakespeare's common devices.

### 6. -> A

All of which is evidence that Shakespeare was a master manipulator of language. In so many of his plays, what he was trying to do was draw our attention to how powerful language is and how it is so often used to manipulate and influence people. But it is important to remember that language belongs to all of us as humans and that we are in control of how it grows and changes.

**A:** Take, for instance, the way numerous characters in Shakespeare's plays are referred to as having been 'cowarded'. In Romeo and Juliet, Juliet's father demands that his daughter 'thank me no thankings and proud me no prouds'. When we hear this sentence out loud in response to Juliet's pleas, the meaning is absolutely clear.

**B:** Given such an impact, it is hardly surprising that Shakespeare is so greatly admired. He changed the way humans tell stories. Some people even believe he was changing what it meant to be a human being, so clearly he would need some interesting new words to help him do that.

**C:** We are also still 'verbing'. Shakespeare loved taking a word that had traditionally been used as a noun and turning it into a verb. Surprisingly, though, some scholars of the English language are outraged by what they see as a modern-day affliction.

**D:** In fact, in Shakespeare's time, it was not playwrights who were the principal inventors of new words. Rather, according to one important research study of the subject, the main source of invention was the way young people used language, often in letters they sent each other.

**E:** Other common words have undergone similar changes in meaning. When Olivia in Twelfth Night says, 'Fate, show thy force; ourselves we do not owe', the verb 'owe' did not imply 'debt' - it meant 'own'. However, less than 10% of the words used in Shakespeare's day have since lost their meaning.

**F:** Of course, Shakespeare was indulging in some invention of his own, quite apart from adopting new expressions. He, for example, was a great combiner of words. That is to say, putting two existing words together to mean something else.

**G:** Despite this, school students are told we still study Shakespeare partly because he invented so many new words. But it seems counter-intuitive for a playwright to do so. If he really did think up thousands of brand-new words, how would his audience have understood his plays?
