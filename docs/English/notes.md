To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing with regard to the misuse of a personal photograph of myself and two of my friends on your website.

The photograph in question is one I posted on my personal blog several months ago, and it involves my friends and I celebrating the end of the examination period at university. Several days ago, I was shocked to discover that my photo had been used in an online advertisement for your study abroad programme. This is both unfair and illegal, as you have been using the photograph without my permission, and as you are advertising a product with it, you are in fact using it for personal gain.

I have taken up this matter with a lawyer, who has advised me to contact you in writing. She has also indicated what further steps might be taken should you fail to respond promptly and appropriately. 

To resolve this matter, I request that you remove the photograph without delay. In addition, I ask that you issue a statement of your policy regarding use of images that are not your property.

Please contact me within one week of the date of this letter to conﬁrm that these steps have been taken. If you need to reach me by telephone, my number is (0141) 985-001.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,
Charlene Jones (Ms)

Hi Miki,
I can relate to what you’re going through. I’m also a bit shy when I’m in new situations, and I used to worry a lot about how I sounded. What helped me most was practicing on my own at home, either by talking out loud to myself or reading things out loud. Over time, it made me more confident, and I found it much easier to start conversations with people.

From my experience, even if you make small mistakes, most people won’t notice, or they’ll forget about it quickly. We usually remember our own mistakes much more than anyone else does. Since your grammar is already good, I think it’s just about confidence. Try practicing a bit at home, and when you feel ready, approach people with your head held high. You might be surprised by how positive they are.

I hope this helps, and I’m wishing you all the best with your speaking in the UK!

Matteo
